## Description
Pawesome Care is a web-application that allows pet owners to upload information about their pet-pals. It is designed with the idea of a ‘social media’ for your pets, a way to store information about your pet that is easily accessible, connect with other pet owners, and share stories and ideas with other users.

Our team are split fans of Cats and Dogs but we appreciate that all pet owners have a special spot for their pets. We wanted to create an application that targets this demographic of pet owners who want to keep track of their pets health, have a way to memorialise their pets online, and engage with other pets and pet owners.

Pawesome Care allows the user to easily create a profile for their pet. They should be able to provide basic information such as the pet's name, breed, age, and any specific details that they want to share or keep, including a short bio or description of the pet's personality and quirks. Once they create a profile, it is saved and accessible for future edits. Pet owners can also connect with other pet owners in their area or beyond, so that they can build a network of like-minded individuals and arrange playdates, share funny stories, and seek advice from their communities. They can share blog posts and photos, as well as comment on other people’s posts to connect and share ideas.
